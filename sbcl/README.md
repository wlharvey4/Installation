# Install SBCL Makefile
## Install Steel Bank Common Lisp from the Command-Line
### About

This  Makefile will  install Steel  Bank Common  Lisp (SBCL)  from the
command-line into `/usr/local/dev/sbcl/src/sbcl-dev`.

The  install  process  requires  another  ANSI-compliant  Common  Lisp
implementation, so  we will  use CCL  for that  purpose, which  can be
installed independently of another implementation.

The executable  is installed as `/usr/local/bin/sbcl`,  and supporting
files   are  installed   into   `/usr/local/share/...`.   No   further
configuration is necessary.
